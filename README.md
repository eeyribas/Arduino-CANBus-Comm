# Arduino-CANBus-Communication
This is an example of CAN-Bus communication with Arduino Uno. There are two applications available in the repository: a sender and a receiver. For CAN-Bus communication, MCP2515 and MCP2551 integrated circuits are used alongside Arduino.

Arduino IDE Version: 2.2.0

CAN-Bus Arduino Library: The library is included in the CAN_BUS_Shield.zip file in the repository. Please include this file in your Arduino Uno IDE.

Arduino Connection Diagram: The connection diagram is shown in the (CAN-Bus Comm Breadbord.jpg) image.
